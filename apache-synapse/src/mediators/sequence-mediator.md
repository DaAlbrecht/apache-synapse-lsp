# Sequence Mediator

The **Sequence Mediator** refers to an already defined sequence element,
which is used to invoke a named sequence of mediators. This is useful
when you need to use a particular set on mediators in a given order
repeatedly.

You can alternatively select a predefined sequence from the RegistryÂ as
the in/out/fault sequence for a proxy service or a REST service without
adding any mediator configurations inline. The difference between these
two options are described in the table below.

| Adding other mediators                            | Other mediator configurations that are not already included in the predefined sequence cannot be added to the in/out/fault sequence.                                                                                                                                    | Other mediator configurations that are not already included in the predefined sequence can be added to the in/out/fault sequence                                                                                                                                    |
